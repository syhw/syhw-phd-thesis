\chapter{BroodwarBotQ: putting it all together}
%%% There's no difference between a pessimist who says, "Oh it's hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything." and an optimist who says, "Don't bother doing anything, it's going to turn out fine anyways. Either way, nothing happens.

\lettrine{I}{n} this chapter, we present some of the engineering that went in the robotic player's (bot) implementation. We will also present the different flows of informations and how decisions are made during a game. Finally we will present the results of the full robotic player to various bots competitions.
