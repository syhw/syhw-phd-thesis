\chapter{Game AI}

%Ninety percent of video game AI really is pretty damn bad. I think that's actually why it's so much fun to shoot things. Because the AI is so bad and the characters are so annoying. Matthew Perry
%Babbage, Charles -- . . .every game of skill is susceptible of being played by an automaton.
%Minsky, Marvin -- It is not that the games and mathematical problems are chosen because they are clear and simple; rather it is that they give us, for the smallest initial structures, the greatest complexity, so that one can engage some really formidable situations after a relatively minimal diversion into programming. From Semantic Information Processing, p. 12. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press (1968).
% If you'd like to know, I can tell you that in your universe you move freely in three dimensions that you call space. You move in a straight line in a fourth, which you call time, and stay rooted to one place in a fifth, which is the first fundamental of probability. After that it gets a bit complicated, and there's all sort of stuff going on in dimensions thirteen to twenty-two that you really wouldn't want to know about. All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the first place. I can easily not say words like "damn" if it offends you. H2G2

 is it? ``Game AI'', simultaneously a research topic, an industry standard practice, from a staple to a part of the gameplay. Its uses range from character animation, to behavior modeling and strategic play. In this chapter, we will give our educated guess about the goals of game AI, and review what exists for a broad category of games: single player games, abstract strategy games, partial information and/or stochastic games, computer games. Let us then focus on game-play (from a player point of view) characteristics of theses games so that we can enumerate game AI needs. %%% XXX

\section{Goals of Game AI}
%\lettrine[lines=1, lhang=.3]{W}{hat} are the goals of game AI?

\subsection{Win}
During the last decade, the video games industry has see the emergence of ``e-sport''. It is the professionalization of certain competitive games at the higher levels, as in sports, with spectators, leagues, sponsors, fans and broadcasts. A %non-exhaustive 
list of major electronic sports games includes (but is not limited to): StarCraft: Brood War, Counter-Strike, Quake III, Warcraft III, Halo, StarCraft II. The first game to have had progamers was StarCraft: Brood War, in Korea, with top players earning more than top soccer players. Nowadays,
Game AI can be used part of the gameplay as a challenge to the player. Some player like competition, some others want to train. A
