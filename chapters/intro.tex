\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-player video games
\item RTS games
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item A new approach to game AI with:
\begin{itemize}
\item first-class uncertainty.
\item a tractable hierarchical decomposition of problems.
\end{itemize}
\item Integration of learning in a decision-making model. 
\item An autonomous agent for StarCraft (BroodwarBotQ).
\end{itemize}

Finally, with this thesis, we hope to contribute a guide for industry practitioners who would like to have new tools for solving the ever increasing complexity of game AI, and more generally ``huge state space'' and multi-scale AI.
