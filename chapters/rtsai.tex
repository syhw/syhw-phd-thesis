\chapter{RTS AI: \textit{StarCraft: Broodwar}}

\section{How does the game works: gameplay}
Really, the best is to play it... But I'll explain it.

\section{Problems, resolutions}

\section{Task decomposition and linking}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem: build a real-scale software piece which is maintainable
\item State of the art: shared memories, shared states
\item Our take: we transmit distributions, states stay in modules
\item Results: XXX (atm too much state), also competitions results
\end{itemize}
