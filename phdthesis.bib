	Abstract = {{Game developers have always striven to create better and more complex games.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in games is increasing in game
development to this end. However there appears to be a mismatch of implications
and expectations between game developers and AI researchers of what AI can
bring to games, mostly due to differences of interpretation of the problems
involved. To overcome this we present a taxonomy to aid knowledge transfer
between the two groups, including elements from environments, game theory, and
information theory. We also identify other concepts of games and AI that could
be important to both sides.}},

@article{MCTSsurvey,
	Abstract = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithms derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

The authors provide precise definitions and full proofs of results, sacrificing generalities and limiting the scope of the material in order to do so. The text is organized in four parts: strategic games, extensive games with perfect information, extensive games with imperfect information, and coalitional games. It includes over 100 exercises.
