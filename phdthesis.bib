	Abstract = {{Game developers have always striven to create better and more complex games.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in games is increasing in game
development to this end. However there appears to be a mismatch of implications
and expectations between game developers and AI researchers of what AI can
bring to games, mostly due to differences of interpretation of the problems
involved. To overcome this we present a taxonomy to aid knowledge transfer
between the two groups, including elements from environments, game theory, and
information theory. We also identify other concepts of games and AI that could
be important to both sides.}},

We build on previous work, where models were derived that predicted player experience based on features of level design and on playing styles. These models are constructed using preference learning, based on questionnaires administered to players after playing different levels. The contributions of the current paper are (1) more accurate models based on a much larger data set; (2) a mechanism for adapting level design parameters to given players and playing style; (3) evaluation of this adaptation mechanism using both algorithmic and human players. The results indicate that the adaptation mechanism effectively optimizes level design parameters for particular players.}

	Abstract = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithms derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

	Abstract = {Interactive narrative systems attempt to tell stories to players capable of changing the direction and/or outcome of the story. Despite the growing importance of multiplayer social experiences in games, little research has focused on multiplayer interactive narrative experiences. We performed a preliminary study to determine how human directors design and execute multiplayer interactive story experiences in online and real world environments. Based on our observations, we developed the Multiplayer Storytelling Engine that manages a story world at the individual and group levels. Our flexible story representation enables human authors to naturally model multiplayer narrative experiences.  An intelligent execution algorithm detects when the author's story representation fails to account for player behaviors and automatically generates a branch to restore the story to the authors' original intent, thus balancing authorability against robust multiplayer execution.},

@inproceedings{Kabanza2010,
	Abstract = {In Real-Time Strategy (RTS) video games, players (controlled by humans or computers) build structures and recruit armies, fight for space and resources in order to control strategic points, destroy the opposing force and ultimately win the game. Players need to predict where and how the opponents will strike in order to best defend themselves.  Conversely, assessing how the opponents will defend themselves is crucial to mounting a successful attack while exploiting the vulnerabilities in the opponent's defence strategy.  In this context, to be truly adaptable, computer-controlled players need to recognize their opponents' behaviour, their goals, and their plans to achieve those goals.  In this paper we analyze the algorithmic challenges behind behaviour recognition in RTS games and discuss a generic RTS behaviour recognition system that we are developing to address those challenges. The application domain is that of RTS games, but many of the key points we discuss also apply to other video game genres such as multiplayer first person shooter (FPS) games.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we apply the idea of testing games by learning interactions with them that cause unwanted behavior of the game to test the competition entries for some of the scenarios of the 2010 StarCraft AI competition. By extending the previously published macro action concept to include macro action sequences for individual game units, by adjusting the concept to the real-time requirements of StarCraft, and by using macros involving specific abilities of game units, our testing system was able to find either weaknesses or system crashes for all of the competition entries of the chosen scenarios. Additionally, by requiring a minimal margin with respect to surviving units, we were able to clearly identify the weaknesses of the tested AIs.},

@paper{AIIDE114048,
	Abstract = {Massive Multiplayer Online Strategy games present several unique challenges to players and designers. There is the need to constantly adapt to changes in the game itself and the need to achieve a certain level of simulation and realism, which typically implies battles involving combat with several distinct armies, combat phases and diferent terrains; resource management which involves buying and selling goods and combining lots of diferent kinds of resources to fund the player's nation and cutthroat diplomacy which dictates the pace of the game. However, these constant changes and simulation mechanisms make a game harder to play, increasing the amount of effort required to play it properly. As some of these games take months to be played, players who become inactive have a negative impact on the game. This work pretends to demonstrate how to create versatile agents for playing Massive Multiplayer Online Turn Based Strategy Games, while keeping close attention to their playing performance. In a test to measure this performance the results showed similar survival performance between humans and AIs.},

@paper{AIIDE114067,
	Abstract = {Gameplay in real-time strategy games seems somehow to be confined to a de facto standard where economical micro-management is equally important as combat strategy, if not more important. To enable stronger combat-oriented gameplay without sacrificing other key aspects of the genre, we propose an automated system for scheduling unit training, which we believe may allow the exploration of new paradigms of play. To be accepted by the player, such a system must, among other things, be efficient and reliable, which is a non-trivial task considering the highly dynamic nature of the environment in this genre of games. To overcome such a challenge, we propose a system inspired in the swarm intelligence demonstrated by social insects, namely wasps, and describe its limitations and benefits, based on the evaluation of an implementation of the approach as a modification of the game Warcraft III The Frozen Throne (Blizzard Entertainment, 2003).},

@paper{AIIDE114068,
	Abstract = {Interactive narrative systems attempt to tell stories to players capable of changing the direction and/or outcome of the story. Despite the growing importance of multiplayer social experiences in games, little research has focused on multiplayer interactive narrative experiences. We performed a preliminary study to determine how human directors design and execute multiplayer interactive story experiences in online and real world environments. Based on our observations, we developed the Multiplayer Storytelling Engine that manages a story world at the individual and group levels. Our flexible story representation enables human authors to naturally model multiplayer narrative experiences.  An intelligent execution algorithm detects when the author's story representation fails to account for player behaviors and automatically generates a branch to restore the story to the authors' original intent, thus balancing authorability against robust multiplayer execution.},
